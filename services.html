<br><h6 style="color:grey"><strong>Benefit of filing Income Tax return</strong></h6>
<p>•	Applying for loans: In case of vehicle loans, all major banks asks for a copy of tax returns. For instance: State Bank of India asks vehicle loan applicants for the latest salary – slip showing all deductions/ TDS certificate / FORM 16/ copy of ITR for the last 2 financial years. Even while applying for HOME LOANS, many banks ask for FORM 16 or even ITR receipts.
<br>•	To claim refund : Most importantly, if you have a refund due from the Income Tax Department, you will have to file returns without which you will have to forgo the refund.
<br>•	To carry forward losses: If you do not file returns you will not be able to carry forward capital losses (short term / long term), if any, in a financial year to be adjusted against capital gains made in the subsequent years.
<br>•	Visa processing: Applying for a visa to undergo foreign travels also requires ITR receipts. If you are travelling overseas, foreign consulates ask you to furnish ITR receipts for the last couple of years at the time of visa interviews. Especially if you are travelling to the US, UK, Canada or Europe. For South East Asia or Middle East the visa laws are not so stringent. One must always carry ITR or income related proof as consulates specify these requirements in most cases. As ITR receipts show some source of income in India, it helps in strengthening one's case that someone will not leave the company for good but will return back.
<br>•	For buying high life covers / policies: Nowadays buying high life covers has become very common i.e. over 50 lakhs to 1crore. These are available against your ITR documents to verify annual income.
<br>•	Government tenders: If one has to plan to start their business and need to fill a government tender or two for the same , they will need to show them tax return receipts of the previous five years to show your financial status and whether you can support the payment obligation / or not. There are no strict rules; it generally depends on the internal rules of Government department.
<br>•	Necessary for self – employed individuals: For all sorts of financial transaction, ITR receipts will be the only proof of income and tax payment of self employed.</p>
